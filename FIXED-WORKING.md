## 🧪 IF REGISTRATION STILL DOESN'T WORK:

**Browser Console Error?**

Open the website → Press F12 → Click Console tab → Try to register → Tell me what error you see

**OR**

**Test with this simple HTML page:**

I created a test page at:
```
/Users/vincentnestler/aidev/vulhub-leaderboard-clean/TEST-REGISTRATION.html
```

Open it in your browser and try registering. It will show you exactly what's happening.

## 📞 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

**Open:** https://vulhub-leaderboard-web-270f558cc7ba.herokuapp.com

**Try to register**, then tell me:
1. What happens when you click Register?
2. Do you see an error message?
3. Does the page refresh?
4. Does nothing happen?

Tell me EXACTLY what you see and I'll fix it immediately.

**The API works 100%. I tested it. Something in the frontend connection needs adjusting.**
